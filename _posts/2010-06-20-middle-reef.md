This dive was headed out on scooters. I held on to Mike's leg and we were out at the sand in no time. We droped down and did a nice dive. I did this dive sans camera because it was giving me trouble. I turned the dive at 1250psi and headed back and did an ascent without a hitch. We scooted back and by the time we got back my tank was really light. This dive was redeeming. My canister flooded so that's a bummer.
