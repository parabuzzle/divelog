This was a short dive to burn the last of the tanks we had. We both decided that we wanted to explore the shallow side of the debris cone and see what fossils we could see. I decided to take the camera back down in photo mode to see what kind of photos the new GoPro Hero 10 could do. We saw a ton of sand dollars and sea biscuits in the ceiling and on the final accent we *finally* found the whale bone. It's not easy to see if you don't know exactly where to look. 

The whale bone is a section of fossilized vertabrae from an ancient whale that is embedded in the rock at the site. The single viewable piece happens to be in about 5 feet of water, in a pocket in the wall, just below the main dock. You need to look inside the hole in the wall and it's clear as day. I'll attach a photo of the bone so you can see what you are looking for.

Beyond the sight seeing on the shallow side, we felt a noticable current coming from the breakdown area on that side. It was pumping noticably colder water out of the cracks and pushing us to the other side slowly.
