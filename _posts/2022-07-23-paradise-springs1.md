Eesa and I went back to Pardise Springs to see it without the mess of students. We were the first in for the day and went to the cave entrance at 95ft. It was really nice and visability was great! 

The area at the "bottom" is a big bowl shape and Eesa was having a grand time just poking around all the nooks and crannies. Her buoancy is starting to get quite good and she may be better with it than me at this point.
