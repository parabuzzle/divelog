First dive in salt water in quite a long time. 

We need a checklist! It was hot outside and we were rushing to get in the water. Once in the water was very nice. My 3mm wetsuit was perfect. 

We saw a ton of fish and other creatures. There was a group of idiot kids that kept knocking into stuff. I wanted to give them a piece of my mind. Idiots!
