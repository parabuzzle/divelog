First time to Paradise Springs. The drive is a bit sketchy and I wasn't planning on diving because it was Eesa's deep checkouts. I'm glad I brought my gear though because there was room for me to dive along. 

The first dive was a rave! Lights everywhere and lots of terrible divers in the water at once. I watched one of the students crawl down to 60 feet. Yes CRAWL on hands and knees down the hill!

Overall it was a fun dive to watch.
