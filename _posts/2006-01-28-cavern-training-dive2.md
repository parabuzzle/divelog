First time in an overhead environment! We went all the way back to the sign. I ran the reel. The flow was intense! One of the students in the class lost it when she hit the ceiling and was done with the class after that. We demonstrated skills by the cave opening (next to the sign) and headed out. I had to work the reel on the way out. The current kept flooding and ripping my mask off and keeping the line tensioned was challenging at best.
