Eesa and I dropped down to work on finning techniques and just swim around a bit. 

Other divers had shown up and started messing up the visability a little and Eesa wanted to practice her frog kick and modified flutter. (We'll get her into the caves eventually).

Overall, Eesa is starting to show me up a bit in her skills and technique and I'm loving it!
