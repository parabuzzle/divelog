This was a shore dive out of point lobos state park. The surface swim was grueling. Once we got out we dropped down and started the dive. I took some photos and saw a lot of star fish. After I hit 1000psi I called and we turned the dive. On the acsent I ran out of air and had to share with Don. Then my feet got air in them and I couldn't control bouyancy. At 10 feet I pulled the reg and did a CESA to the surface. We kicked back to the ramp. I was so embarrassed.
