After a nice lunch at the site, still all to ourselves, we swapped tanks and did a final dive for the day.

The plan was to drop down to the hole in the wall at around 80 feet and have a poke around to see what we could see of that side tunnel. Then we would head up to the 45 foot level to continue looking at fossils embedded in the walls. I took the camera back down on photo mode and off we went. 

The first thing we noticed was that the visibility had improved quite a bit. Since we were the only ones there all day, it was interesting how much a few hours can change the visibility of the site.

When we got to the tunnel at 80 feet it was obvious that there was a flow of colder water coming out of there as well. We really couldn't see too far around the corner and there was no way we were going to go in there so we moved on to the second part of our dive and headed to 45 feet.

I was dinking with my camera and blew through the 45 foot level while taking photos and looking at the walls for fossils. When I realized I dropped back down and continued the tour around at about 40 feet. 

After a bit of just touring around and taking random photos Eesa got cold and called the dive. I captured an epic shot during the safety stop and packed up and went home for the day. 

Such a magical day at Paradise springs. We had the whole place to ourselves.
