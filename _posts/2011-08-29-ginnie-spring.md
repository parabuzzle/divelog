This dive got off to a rocky start. I was underweight and tired myself out fighting the bouyancy. After adjusting my weight we started the dive. 

We did the tour of the ballroom and Lisa got to expierence the flow. I started to feel sick so I thumbed the dive a little early. We saw a few over-friendly fish and the elusive blind eel in the cave.
